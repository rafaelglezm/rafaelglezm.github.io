Welcome to my academic website.

I am **Rafael González-Manzanares**, MD, PhD, a clinical cardiologist and academic researcher based in Córdoba, Spain. My professional work combines patient care—especially in heart failure and complex cardiovascular disease—with applied clinical research.

I currently hold a **Juan Rodés research contract** funded by the **Carlos III Health Institute (Madrid, Spain)**, focusing on **heart failure** and **cardio-oncology**.

I also hold an **MSc in Statistics for Clinical Trials from University College London (UCL)**. My main research interests include the application of advanced statistical methods to cardiovascular research and R programming.

This site presents my publications, ongoing projects, and academic collaborations.  
Feel free to get in touch if you are interested in working together.
